# AI-Agent Liver Transplant Commitee 
## :pushpin: Project Overview
This repository contains an AI-driven Liver Transplant Committee Decision System that evaluates patient eligibility for liver transplantation. The system processes clinical vignettes and uses AI agents representing medical professionals—including a Hepatologist, Cardiologist, Transplant Surgeon, and Social Worker—to assess one-year survival probability post-transplant.
The project is implemented using CrewAI, LangChain, and OpenAI's GPT-4o for decision-making.
